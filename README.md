# Matrix_Calculator
## Program to do basic calculations with matrices in the terminal

My inicial incentive is to apply linear algebra knowledge to a computer software. I have been using Octave and MatLab to do matrix calculations during College and like to try to create my own simplified version of those softwares.

My inicial language of choice will be C++ to start this project.
